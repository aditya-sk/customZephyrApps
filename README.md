# Out of tree custom Applications using Zephyr


## [Overview](#overview)
These peripheral applications are developed based on Microchip SAMV71 microcontroller using ZephyrProject infrastructure as guide for beginners.

## [Features](#features)
This repository consists of the following Projects:
1. Blinky
2. Blinky Two Threads
3. Blinky PWM
4. Producer
5. Producer Consumer
6. Producer Consumer Queue

## NOTE:
This applicaitons are created on Windows OS machine and to run these appliction, you need to install OpenOCD for debugging and flashing the hex/elf file onto microcontroller.


# [Pre-requisites and tools to build locally](#pre-requisites-and-steps-to-test-locally)


## Software Setup
Install Zephyr SDK and set up your development environment by following [Zephyr Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html).

Install OpenOCD and set up your debugger and flash tool by following [Flash and debug host tools](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/flash_debug/host-tools.html#flash-debug-host-tools)
